How dare they show us pictures of **happy** students?

This extension replaces the happy students with real, depressed students, and helps restore peace to the world of Moodle.

# How to install:

2. Go to chrome's extensions page: [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) at chrome://extensions/
3. Enable developer mode

Now every time you visit moodle, the pictures will be replaced with the correct ones.
